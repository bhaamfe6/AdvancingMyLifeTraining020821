# Java: Generics
Generics were added in Java 5 to provide compile-time checking and also helps to remove the risk of ClassCastException.  Thios allows us to achieve ***<u>type-safety</u>*** , expecially when using `Java Collections` .

Java allows us to define classes with generic types, which are classes or interfaces that are parameterized.  We can use anle brackets to specify parameter types.
