# Java: Access Modifiers
Access modifiers help to restrict the accessibility of a class, consttructor, field, or method.  We have four possible access modifiers in Java, from most restrictive to least:
1. **Private**
    - Allows for access only within the same class
2. **Default**
    - it is the access modifier level whenever we don't explicitly give an access modifier to a class member
    - allows for access from any class in the same package
    - the dafault keyword is diffrent from the default access modifier
3. **Protected**
    - allows from access within the same package and subclasses outside that package
4. **Public**
    - allows for access anywhere
