# Java: Class, Object, and Reference Variable
Understand the difference between a Class, an Object, and a Reference Variable:
- **Class**: a template used to instantiate objects.
    - Also called a **type** when used with a reference variable
    - Used to instantiate an object and determine what states and behaviors an object will have
    - Used to determine what hehaviors of an object can be invoked and how any variables get initialzed
- **Object**: an instance of a class in memory
    - You interact with oojects through reference or the *memory address* used by the JVM to find a particular object
- **Reference Variable**: a variable that stores the reference to an object in memory.
    - Similar to how primitive variables determine the range of values that a primitive can store, the **type** of reference variable determines the **type** of object a reference variable can store
        - When a ***class*** is used as the **type**, that ***reference*** can only be used to invoke behaviors of the object that are declared in the ***class/type***
